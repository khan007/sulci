===============

* You're a python killer: there is many optimizations to do in the actual code

* You're a language expert: all the algorithm can be optimized

* You know well French language: you can add texts in the POS corpus, or make a 
  proof read of the actual texts (in corpus/\*.crp)

* You're an enthusiast: you can play with the demo, with the debug, and make
  tickets for the bug seen ; you can help for making the doc, etc.
