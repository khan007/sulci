Sulci
=====

Sulci is a French text mining tool, initially designed for the analysis of
the corpus and thesaurus of `Libération <http://www.liberation.fr/>`_, a 
French newspaper.

This code is "work in progress", but it's yet used in production at Libération.

Therefore, here is a demo page with the frozen 0.1 alpha version:
 
 http://alpha.sulci.dotcloud.com

To use it, to get more info, have a look a the 
`documentation <http://readthedocs.org/docs/sulci/>`_.

How can I help?
---------------

* You're a python killer: there is many optimizations to do in the actual code

* You're a language expert: all the algorithm can be optimized

* You know well French language: you can add texts in the POS corpus, or make a 
proof read of the actual texts (in corpus/\*.crp)

* You're an enthusiast: you can play with the demo, with the debug, and make
tickets for the bug seen ; you can help for making the doc, etc.

* in any case,
  Meet us for IRC chats: #sulci on irc.freenode.net
